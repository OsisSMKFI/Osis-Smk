-- Complete repair script: synchronize `members` with `sekbid` so public /people shows correct data
-- IMPORTANT: BACKUP your database before running this. Test by running the SELECT blocks first.
-- Recommended: run this in Supabase SQL editor step-by-step.

-- 7) OPTIONAL: Ensure members with a sekbid are active so they appear on /people
-- Uncomment the following block only if you understand it will set `is_active = true` for ALL members with a sekbid.
-- Useful if your admin expects sekbid members to always be visible publicly.
-- Note: Comment is intentionally present. Remove the surrounding comment markers to execute.

-- UPDATE members
-- SET is_active = TRUE

-- 8) Ensure display_order exists (if null) by setting to 0 where missing (idempotent)
UPDATE members

-- 9) Final sanity checks: show some sample rows grouped by sekbid

       COALESCE(m.name, m.nama) AS name,
       COALESCE(m.role, m.jabatan) AS role,

       COALESCE(m.display_order, m.order_index, 0) AS display_order
FROM members m
LEFT JOIN sekbid s ON m.sekbid_id = s.id
ORDER BY m.sekbid_id NULLS LAST, COALESCE(m.display_order, m.order_index, 0) ASC

-- Notes and safety guidance:
-- - Run the SELECT preview blocks first and inspect results before running the UPDATEs.
-- - The script is written to be idempotent where practical.
-- - The optional activation step is commented out; only enable it if you want to make sekbid members public immediately.
-- - After running, restart Next dev server and clear .next cache if necessary, then reload /people.
--   (Remove .next and run `npm run dev` locally.)
-- - If you prefer an automated Node script (logs each row changed), use `scripts/run-fix-sekbid-sync.js` in the repo.
