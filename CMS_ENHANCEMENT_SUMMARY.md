## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Changes
**New Endpoint:**
```typescript
DELETE /api/admin/content?pageKey=home_hero_title
Response: { success: true, message: "Content deleted successfully" }
```

**Updated Behavior:**
- All content operations support image URLs from ImageUploader
- No orphaned files: Future enhancement could add storage cleanup on delete

### Database Schema
No schema changes required. Existing `page_content` table already supports:
- `page_key` (unique identifier)
- `content_type` (text/image/richtext)
- `content_value` (stores image URL for type=image)

### Component Reuse
`ImageUploader` component now used in:
1. ✅ Gallery admin
2. ✅ Events admin
3. ✅ Announcements admin
4. ✅ Content Management System (new!)
