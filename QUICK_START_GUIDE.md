# 🚀 **QUICK START GUIDE - PREMIUM ATTENDANCE SYSTEM**

## ⚡ **5-MINUTE SETUP**

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration (2 minutes)**

```bash
# 1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
https://app.supabase.com/project/[your-project-id]/sql

# 2. Open file: SETUP_ENROLLMENT_SYSTEM.sql

# 3. Copy ALL contents and paste to SQL Editor

# 4. Click "Run" button (or Ctrl+Enter)

### **Step 2: Enable GPS Bypass (30 seconds)** ⚠️ TESTING ONLY

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE school_location_config 
SET 
  bypass_gps_validation = true,
  allowed_ip_ranges = ARRAY[
    '192.168.0.0/16',
    '10.0.0.0/8',
    '182.10.0.0/16',
    '100.64.0.0/10',
    '0.0.0.0/0'  -- Allow ALL IPs for testing
  ]
WHERE is_active = true;

-- Verify
SELECT location_name, bypass_gps_validation, allowed_ip_ranges 
FROM school_location_config WHERE is_active = true;
```

**OR use Admin Panel:**
1. Login: https://osissmktest.biezz.my.id/admin
2. Go to: `/admin/attendance/settings`
3. Check: "🧪 GPS Bypass Mode"
4. Click: "💾 Simpan Konfigurasi"

---

### **Step 3: Test Enrollment (3 minutes)**

```bash
# 1. Create new test user (if needed)
- Email: test@example.com
- Password: Test123!
- Role: siswa

# 2. Login to app
https://osissmktest.biezz.my.id/login

# 3. Should auto-redirect to /enroll

# 4. STEP 1: Upload Face Photo
- Click "Capture Face Photo"
- Allow camera permission
- Take clear selfie (face frontal, good lighting)
- Wait 5-10 seconds for AI verification
- Should see: "✅ All 8 Layers Passed! Score: XX.X%"

# 5. STEP 2: Register Passkey
- Click "Register Passkey"
- Windows Hello prompt appears (or fingerprint on mobile)
- Authenticate with biometric
- Should see: "✅ Passkey registered!"

# 6. Enrollment Complete
- Click "Go to Attendance System →"
- Redirected to /attendance ✅
```

---

### **Step 4: Test Attendance (2 minutes)**

```bash
# 1. At /attendance page
- See green checkmarks for WiFi, Location, Biometric
- Security score: 90/100 (bypass mode) or 100/100 (production)

# 2. Click "Lanjut Ambil Foto & Absen"
- Camera opens
- Take selfie
- AI verifies face (5-10 seconds)
- Should see: "✅ Verifikasi selesai! Match: XX.X%"

# 3. Optional: Fill "Keterangan" field
- Example: "Hadir tepat waktu"

# 4. Click "✅ Kirim Absensi"
- Processing 3-5 seconds
- Success: "🎉 Absensi berhasil!"

# 5. Verify in Admin Panel
- Go to: /admin/attendance
- See your attendance record
- Photo comparison, GPS location, AI score ✅
```

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: "Challenge not found or expired"**
**Solution**: User took too long during passkey registration. Click "Register Passkey" again.

### **Problem: "Verification failed" (8-layer AI)**
**Possible causes**:
- ❌ Photo too dark/bright → Retake with better lighting
- ❌ Mask detected → Remove mask
- ❌ Face not frontal → Look straight at camera
- ❌ Poor quality → Use better camera

**Solution**: Click "Retake" and try again with clear, frontal photo.

### **Problem: "Passkey registration failed"**
**Possible causes**:
- Browser doesn't support WebAuthn (use Chrome 67+, Edge 79+, Safari 14+)
- No biometric sensor available
- Windows Hello not set up

**Solution**: 
1. Check browser compatibility
2. Set up Windows Hello in Windows Settings
3. Or use mobile device with fingerprint/FaceID

### **Problem: GPS blocking (OUTSIDE_RADIUS)**
**Solution**: Enable GPS bypass mode (see Step 2 above)

### **Problem: Enrollment status check stuck**
**Solution**: 
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check database migration completed

## 📊 **VERIFICATION QUERIES**

### **Check enrollment status**
```sql
SELECT * FROM enrollment_dashboard ORDER BY name;
```

### **Check security events**
```sql
SELECT 
  event_type, 
  description, 
  COUNT(*) as count 
FROM security_events 
GROUP BY event_type, description 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### **Check failed verifications**
```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  metadata->>'recommendation' as result,
  metadata->>'overallScore' as score,
  metadata->>'passedLayers' as layers,
  created_at
FROM security_events
WHERE event_type = 'enrollment_photo_verification'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Check GPS bypass usage**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as bypass_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM security_events
WHERE event_type = 'gps_bypass_used';
```

---

## ⚠️ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

### **Before going live:**

1. **Disable GPS Bypass**:
```sql
UPDATE school_location_config 
SET bypass_gps_validation = false 
WHERE is_active = true;
```

2. **Strict IP Ranges**:
```sql
UPDATE school_location_config 
SET allowed_ip_ranges = ARRAY[
  '192.168.0.0/16',  -- School internal
  '10.0.0.0/8',      -- Private network
  '182.10.0.0/16'    -- School ISP (adjust to actual)
  -- ❌ Remove '0.0.0.0/0'
]
WHERE is_active = true;
```

3. **Set proper GPS radius**:
```sql
UPDATE school_location_config 
SET radius_meters = 50  -- Or appropriate value
WHERE is_active = true;
```

4. **Verify security settings**:
```sql
SELECT 
  location_name,
  bypass_gps_validation,  -- Should be FALSE
  radius_meters,          -- Should be 50-200
  allowed_ip_ranges,      -- Should NOT have 0.0.0.0/0
  latitude, longitude
FROM school_location_config
WHERE is_active = true;
```
